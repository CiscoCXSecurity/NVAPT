NVAPT: Not Very Advanced Persistent Threat for iOS. (c) Russ Spooner (rus@portcullis-security.com)

Redistribution of this, or associated files is strictly discouraged.

Very Alpha version, use at your own risk, never for evil. Be warned it will possibly destroy humanity or something equally inconvenient....

Prerequisites:

A Jailbroken device... on to which you should install, I will leave it to your own skill and ingenuity to achieve this:

- openssh (to get the files on the device)
- recAudio from http://ericasadun.com/ftp/EricaUtilities/EricaUtilitiesBeta-14-fw21.zip
- sqlite3
- ncftp

Execution:

Put all the files in "root"'s home directory.

Edit sleeper.sh for it to point at an ftp server of your choice.

run cal.sh for it to execute once (it will scrape all calendar events for the day and set up a sleeper shell for each)

or

Run NVAPT.sh in order to  install it via launchd to run daily.....
